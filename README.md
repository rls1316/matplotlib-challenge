# Objective
Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

Analyze the data and generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. Provide a top-level summary of the study results.

# Final Summary
* Tumor Volumes for Mice on Drug Regimen treatments of Capomulin and Ramicane are significantly smaller than those on Infuinol and Ceftamin at the end of their treatment regimen (See Final Tumor Volume By Treatment BoxPlot)
* There is a strong correlation between the Weight of the Mouse and the size of their tumor for mice on the Capomulin Drug Regimen. Based on the data provided we can see the heavier the mouse, the larger the tumor by volume is. (See 'Capomulin: Average Tumor Volume vs Mouse Weight' ScatterPlot)
* There is only 1 outlier present in the data evaluated, this would indicate that the data results are consistent and we can draw reliably accurate conclusions on the level of effectiveness of each Drug Regimen.
